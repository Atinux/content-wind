## Setup

```

Or start by clicking on **Use this template** on [github.com/Atinux/content-wind](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind).

## Usage

This template has some built-in features to make it as easy as possible to create a content-driven website.

### Pages

Create your pages in the `content/` directory:

```md
# My title

This first paragraph will be treated as the page meta description.
```

You can overwrites the meta tags easily by using front-matter:

```md
---
head.title: 'Custom <title>'
head.description: 'Custom meta description'
head.image: 'Custom image injected as `og:image`'
---

# My title

This first paragraph will be treated as the page meta description.
```

This is done thanks to the great [`<ContentDoc>`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/components/content-doc) component of Nuxt Content.

### Navigation

The navigation is generated from your pages, you can take a look at the [`<Navbar>`](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind/blob/main/components/Navbar.vue) component to see how it works.

It is using the [`<ContentNavigation>`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/components/content-navigation) component from Nuxt Content to fetch the navigation object.

To customize the title displayed in the navigation, you can set the `navTitle` front-matter on your pages:

```md
---
navTitle: 'Home'
---

# Welcome to my site

With a beautiful description
```

### Icons

Use any icon from [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org) with the `<Icon>` component:

```html
<Icon name="ph:music-notes-fill" />
```

You can also use it in your Markdown:

```md
:icon{name="ph:music-notes-fill"}
```

Will result to :icon{name="ph:music-notes-fill"}

### Code Highlight

It support code highlighting with Shiki and support different [VS Code themes](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md#all-themes).

::markdown-block
\```ts
export default () => 'Hello Content Wind'
\```
::

Will result to:

```ts
export default () => 'Hello Content Wind'
```

Updating the theme is as simple as editing your `nuxt.config`:

```ts
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    highlight: {
      theme: 'one-dark-pro',
    }
  }
})
```

Learn more in [Content Code Highlight section](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/configuration#highlight).

### Vue Components

Add your Vue components into `components/content/` and start using them in your Markdown.

See the `<Alert>` component in [`components/content/Alert.vue`](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind/blob/main/components/content/Alert.vue), by leveraging the [`<Markdown>`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/components/markdown) component from Nuxt Content, you can use both slots and props in Markdown thanks to the [MDC syntax](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/mdc).

```md
::alert{icon="ph:circle-wavy-warning-duotone"}
#title
This is an alert
#default
This is the default content of my alert!
::
```

Will result to:

::alert{icon="ph:circle-wavy-warning-duotone"}
#title
This is an alert
#default
This is the default content of my alert!
::

If you want to go deeper, you can take a look at the [`components/content/List.vue`](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind/blob/main/components/content/List.vue) component to see some `useUnwrap()` magic :magic_wand:
